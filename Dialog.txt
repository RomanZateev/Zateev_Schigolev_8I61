-DOROU. Have you heard that our boss want get rid the coffee area, where we usually have lunch during the breaks.
-Oh my got, really? 
 The boss want to get rid of the only place where we are able to have a rest during hard working day and
 where we usually have some informal meetings?
-Yes. He thinks that we spend too much time there. If we stop wasting time, we may do much work.
 We drink tea really often. But, in my opinion, we do not lose concentration during the work day. 
 I do not know where we'll have dinner or some meetings.
-So, it will be a great loss for us if the boss realize this plan. 
 Because the scientists proved that employees should have 5-10 minute breaks every hour during the work. 
 Unless they are tend to lose attentiveness and productivity, which is crutial for every worker.
 Maybe we are able to gather people who are against such innovation and tell the boss our demands.
 Or what do you think?
-Don't be afraid. He only plans this step. There is not decree about this problem. In my opinion, our productity 
depends on rest and therefore we won't recover. We must unite and write manifesto about saving food cord. 
I think we can influence on him.
